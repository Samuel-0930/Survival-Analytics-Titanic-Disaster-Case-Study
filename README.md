## Overview
This project applies a data science framework to predict survival outcomes (binary classification) for passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset provides information such as age, gender, class, and other factors that influenced survival.

The solution demonstrates key data science practices, including:
- Problem definition
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning modeling and validation

## Project Framework
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. **Problem Definition**: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available features.
2. **Data Collection**: Utilize the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle.
3. **Data Preparation**: Process and clean the raw data, handling missing values and outliers.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore patterns, correlations, and distributions within the data.
5. **Modeling**: Train and validate machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees).
6. **Evaluation**: Validate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
7. **Optimization**: Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle and consists of two files:

- **train.csv**: Contains labeled data for model training.
- **test.csv**: Contains unlabeled data for predictions.

Key features include:
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `Sex`: Gender
- `Age`: Age in years
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Fare`: Ticket price
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation

---

## Results
The project achieves the following:
- Identification of key factors influencing survival (e.g., gender, class, age).
- Implementation of various machine learning models, with performance compared using metrics such as accuracy and ROC-AUC.

Best-performing model: **[DecisionTreeClassifier]** with an accuracy of **[0.77751]**.
